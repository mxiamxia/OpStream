AWS EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) Overview

EC2 is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers. EC2 offers a wide range of instance types optimized for different use cases.

Common EC2 Instance Types:

1. General Purpose Instances (e.g., t3, m5)
   - Balanced compute, memory, and network resources
   - Suitable for web servers, development environments, and code repositories

2. Compute Optimized Instances (e.g., c5, c6g)
   - High performance processors
   - Ideal for batch processing, high performance computing, and gaming servers

3. Memory Optimized Instances (e.g., r5, x1, z1)
   - Fast performance for workloads that process large data sets in memory
   - Good for high-performance databases, distributed web caches, and in-memory analytics

4. Storage Optimized Instances (e.g., d2, i3, h1)
   - High, sequential read/write access to very large data sets
   - Ideal for data warehousing, log processing, and distributed file systems

EC2 Pricing Models:

1. On-Demand Instances
   - Pay for compute capacity by the hour with no long-term commitments
   - Recommended for short-term, irregular workloads

2. Reserved Instances
   - Significant discount compared to On-Demand
   - Commitment to a one or three-year term
   - Available in Standard, Convertible, and Scheduled types

3. Spot Instances
   - Request spare computing capacity at steep discounts
   - Prices fluctuate based on supply and demand
   - Can be terminated if EC2 needs the capacity back

4. Dedicated Hosts
   - Physical servers dedicated for your use
   - Can help meet compliance requirements
   - Allows you to use your existing server-bound software licenses

Key EC2 Features:

- Amazon Machine Images (AMIs): Pre-configured templates for instances
- Elastic Block Store (EBS): Persistent block storage volumes
- Security Groups: Virtual firewalls that control traffic to instances
- Elastic IP Addresses: Static IPv4 addresses for dynamic cloud computing
- Auto Scaling: Automatically add or remove capacity based on demand
- Load Balancing: Distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances

Best Practices:

1. Always use security groups to restrict access to your instances
2. Use IAM roles for EC2 instances instead of storing AWS credentials on instances
3. Regularly back up your instances using EBS snapshots or AMIs
4. Use tags to organize and manage your EC2 resources
5. Monitor your instances using Amazon CloudWatch
6. Choose the right instance type and pricing model for your workload
